While working with AI for coding, keep these things in mind:

### AI as code generator
Think it as of a junior level developer produce low level codes.

### AI as code reviewer
Think it as of a senior level developer who can review your codes.


### Prompt to prompt
- The key idea is to make the context window short as possible so that it can get the attention on main task.
- Use "DO NOT WRITE CODE" helps while discussing the project.
- AI as prompt to prompt generator
  - Use chatGPT to generate prompt, give it your requirement allows to ask as much possible questions as possible then answer this and got a prompt for the code development
  - Use this prompt as a prompt to another models e.g., cluade etc. to generate codes.
 
### List of tools
- Cursor Code Editor
- Cluade Code (Paid now)
