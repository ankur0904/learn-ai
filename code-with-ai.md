While working with AI for coding, keep these things in mind:

### AI as code generator
Think it as of a junior level developer produce low level codes.

### AI as code reviewer
Think it as of a senior level developer who can review your codes.

- The key idea is to make the context window short as possible so that it can get the attention on main task.
- Use "DO NOT WRITE CODE" helps while discussing the project.
- AI as prompt to prompt generator
  - Use chatGPT to generate prompt, give it your requirement allows to ask as much possible questions as possible then answer this and got a prompt for the code development
